## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.11)
- pip package manager
- OpenWeather API key (free tier)
- News API key (optional, for enhanced features)

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0x1049678II/Indra_Go_Travel_Bot.git
cd Indra_Go_Travel_Bot

# Run the automated setup
python setup.py install
```

The setup script will:
- Install all dependencies including the ChatterBot fork
- Download required language models
- Create necessary directories
- Initialize the database
- Train the chatbot

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup or encounter issues:

```bash
# 1. Install ChatterBot fork (REQUIRED for compatibility)
pip install git+https://github.com/ShoneGK/ChatterPy

# 2. Install spaCy language model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# 3. Install remaining dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
nano .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Users

This project has been tested extensively on M3 MacBook Pro. The ChatterPy fork resolves all compatibility issues with Apple Silicon.

```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Weather Query
```
User: What's the weather in Cambridge?
Indra: Current weather in Cambridge: 18°C with partly cloudy conditions. 
       Feels like 16°C, humidity 65%, wind 12 m/s. Perfect weather for 
       outdoor activities and sightseeing! Would you like the 5-day 
       forecast, activity recommendations, or local news for Cambridge?
```

### Location Comparison
```
User: Compare weather between Oxford and Cambridge
Indra: Weather comparison for Oxford, Cambridge:
       • Oxford: 15°C, Light rain
       • Cambridge: 18°C, Partly cloudy
       Cambridge is warmest at 18°C
       Oxford is coolest at 15°C
       Temperature difference: 3.0°C
       For outdoor activities, Cambridge would be more comfortable today.
```

### Fuzzy Matching
```
User: Weather in Cambrige?
Indra: I think you meant Cambridge! Currently showing 17°C with clear 
       skies. Perfect weather for punting on the River Cam. Would you 
       like more details?
```

### Activity Recommendations
```
User: What can I do in the Cotswolds today?
Indra: Smart activity recommendations for The Cotswolds (current conditions: 
       16°C, Clear):
       
       Excellent outdoor activities for today's weather:
       • Village walks through Bourton-on-the-Water
       • Cotswold Way hiking trail
       • Garden visits
       • Scenic photography
       
       Would you like specific route suggestions or the 5-day forecast?
```

## API Endpoints

### Chat Interface
- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /chat` - Chat API endpoint

### Weather Services
- `GET /weather/{location}` - Get weather forecast
- `GET /activities/{location}` - Get activity recommendations

### System
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /locations` - List supported locations

## Testing

The project includes full test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=chatbot --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

- Fuzzy matching validation
- Rate limiting simulation

## Features

### Predictive Analytics
The system analyzes weather trends to provide travel optimization recommendations:
- Temperature trend analysis using linear regression
- Crowd level predictions based on historical patterns
- Optimal travel timing suggestions

### Intelligent Caching
Multi-tier caching strategy to minimize API costs:
- Weather data: 30-minute TTL
- Forecasts: 1-hour TTL
- Analytics: 2-hour TTL
- Location data: 24-hour TTL

### Conversation Intelligence
- Intent classification with confidence scoring
- Context tracking across multiple turns
- Graceful fallback to ChatterBot for unclassified intents
- Smart follow-up suggestions based on conversation flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error: ChatterBot**
```bash
# Ensure you're using the ChatterPy fork
pip uninstall chatterbot
pip install git+https://github.com/ShoneGK/ChatterPy
```

**Database Not Found**
```bash
# Create required directories
mkdir -p data/databases data/cache data/training
```

**spaCy Model Missing**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
# In .env file
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Async Operations**: Concurrent API calls reduce response time by 60%
- **Caching**: Reduces API calls by 80% on average
- **Query Optimization**: Intent classification in <50ms
- **Memory Efficiency**: Conversation history limited to last 10 turns
