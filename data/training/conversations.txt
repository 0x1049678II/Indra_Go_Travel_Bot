- Eastern areas: Much drier at 800mm annually
- Rain often comes in showers with sunny breaks

Current conditions: 13°C with light clouds - no rain expected today!

Making the Most of Cumbria Weather:
- "No such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing" - local saying
- Rain creates spectacular waterfalls and moody landscapes
- Between showers often produce stunning rainbows
- Misty conditions add atmosphere to the fells

This Week's Forecast:
- Today-Tomorrow: Dry with sunny intervals
- Wednesday: Morning showers, clearing afternoon
- Thursday-Friday: Mixed conditions

The key is being prepared and flexible. Many visitors find the changeable weather adds to Cumbria's drama and beauty. Would you like tips for enjoying the Lakes in any weather?
